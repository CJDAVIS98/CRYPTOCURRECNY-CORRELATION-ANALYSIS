CODE INSTRUCTIONS



On the terminal, please type python SCRAPER.py to run the code
Please ensure that the "ethervol.csv" file is in the same folder as the "SCRAPER.py" file.

The webscraped data, DATASET 1 'CoinGecko_Dataset', will not run within this .py file; therefore, resort to jupyter notebook code 


Therefore, to view the dataframe and visual analysis of webscraped DATASET 1 'CoinGecko_Dataset' please refer to the Jupyter Notebook titled 'CONNOR_DAVIS_FINAL_PROJECT_NOTEBOOK'


The dataframe of DATASET 2 'CoinDesk_Dataset' should run alongside the opening visual analysis files within the .py file 
The dataframe of DATASET 3 'ethervol' should run alongside the opening visual analysis files within the .py file 


For any further analysis on the block of function code going into the .py file please refer to the notebook titled 'CONNOR_DAVIS_FINAL_PROJECT_TERMINAL_CODE'
