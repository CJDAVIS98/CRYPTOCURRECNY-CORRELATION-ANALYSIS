- Please ensure that the "ethervol.csv" file is in the same folder as the "SCRAPER.py" file.

- The webscraped data, DATASET 1 'CoinGecko_Dataset', will not run within this .py file; therefore, resort to       jupyter notebook code 
- The dataframe of DATASET 2 'CoinDesk_Dataset' should run alongside the opening visual analysis files within the   .py file 

- The dataframe of DATASET 3 'ethervol' should run alongside the opening visual analysis files within the .py file

- To view the dataframe and visual analysis of webscraped DATASET 1 'CoinGecko_Dataset' please refer to   the       Jupyter Notebook titled 'CONNOR_DAVIS_FINAL_PROJECT_NOTEBOOK'

- For any further analysis on the block of function code going into the .py file please refer to the notebook       titled 'CONNOR_DAVIS_FINAL_PROJECT_TERMINAL_CODE'
